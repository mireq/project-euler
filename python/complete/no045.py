# Triangular: T_n = n(n+1)/2
# Pentagonal: P_n = n(3n-1)/2
# Hexagonal: H_n = n(2n-1)

# T_285 = P_165 = H_143
# Find the next such Triangular number.

# T and H: a^2 + a = 4c^2 - 2c
# 4a^2 + 4a + 1 = 16c^2 - 8c + 1
# (2a + 1)^2 = (4c - 1)^2
# 2a + 1 = 4c - 1
# a = 2c - 1

# T and P: a^2 + a = 3b^2 - b
# 4a^2 + 4a + 1 = 12b^2 - 4b + 1
# 3(2a + 1)^2 = 36b^2 - 12b + 1 + 2 = (6b - 1)^2 + 2
# Solve 3x^2 - y^2 = 2
# Required: x = 2a + 1 = 4c - 1, y = 6b - 1 (modular residues)

# Base solution (x,y) = (1,1), if we view the river of the form
# f((x,y)) = 3x^2 - y^2 with u_0 = (1,0) and v_0 = (0,1) we have
# f(u_0) = 3, f(v_0) = -1 we have the general transformation along the
# river u_{n+1} = 2u_n + 3v_n, v_{n+1} = u_n + 2v_n
# which gives u_{n+2} - 2u_{n+1} - 2(u_{n+1} - 2u_n)
# = 3v_{n+1} - 2(3v_n) = 3u_n which implies
# u_{n+2} - 4u_{n+1} + u_n = 0 (and similarly for v_n)
# We know also that since u + v gives the solutions to 3x^2 - y^2 = 2
# that the solutions we want also follow this recurrence.
# Let s_0 = (1,1) and s_1 = (3,5)
# We seek solutions s_n such that s_n(x) = 3 mod 4 and s_n(y) = 5 mod 6.

# s_n(x) Modulo 4:
# f{n+2} = 4f{n+1} - f{n} = -f{n} mod 4
# 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, ...
# indices == 1 and 2 mod 4 give s_n(x) == 3

# s_n(y) Modulo 6:
# f{n+2} = 4f{n+1} - f{n}
# (1, 5,) (1, 5,) (1, 5,) (1, 5,) (1, 5,) ...
# indices == 1 mod 2

# Combining we must have n == 1 mod 4

# The solution we were given is a = 285, x = 2a + 1 = 571 which gives y = 989
# and is at index 5

# The next solution happens when n = 9
# 2a + 1 = x_9
# 8T_a + 1 = 4a^2 + 4a + 1 =  x_9^2
# T_a = (x_9^2 - 1)/8
